An Android app 2 player chess game.

A practice app chess game that allows two players to play on a turn-by-turn basis.  
Still a work in progress.

Dedicated to my king, the man who encouraged me to get my head back in the game.
I'll always treasure that night we played chess together on the flight back home.
